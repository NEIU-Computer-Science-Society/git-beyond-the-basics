**GIT - BEYOND THE BASICS**

The Computer Science Society at NEIU is hosting a hands-on workshop 
for people interested in learning more about Git.

There is no official date yet.
But if you are one who would like to learn more about Git and how
to collaborate with others using Git, please follow the 
instructions below.

**Instructions**

0. There is no sign-up sheet for this event.

1. In order to sign-up you must fork this repository to your 
   account on GitHub. See https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull
   for more info about the "Fork & Pull" collaborative model.
   
2. Using your choice of Git utility (GitHub for Windows or Mac 
   are recommended for beginners)(https://windows.github.com or 
   https://mac.github.com/), clone the forked repository to your 
   desktop using the "Clone in Desktop" button on GitHub.

2. Create a .txt file in the /collaborators directory of the 
   repository.

3. The filename should be in the form firstname_lastname.txt 
   (any other underscore delimited form of your name beginning with 
   your first name is acceptable).

4. In the file, you must include a sentence or two about why you 
   would like to learn more about Git.*

5. Commit the file to the repository.

6. Push the repository on your desktop back up to your Github 
   account (use Sync feature in Github for Windows or Mac).

7. Create a pull request on GitHub once your changes are on GitHub.
   See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/ and
   https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ for more info.

*Seriously folks, write "I want to learn how to better collaborate with 
others using Git" if you can't think of anything else to write. That is 
what you're trying to accomplish right?
